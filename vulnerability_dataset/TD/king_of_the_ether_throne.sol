// A chain-game contract that maintains a 'throne' which agents may pay to rule.
// See www.kingoftheether.com & https://github.com/kieranelby/KingOfTheEtherThrone .
// (c) Kieran Elby 2016. All rights reserved.
// v0.4.0.
// Inspired by ethereumpyramid.com and the (now-gone?) "magnificent bitcoin gem".

// This contract lives on the blockchain at 0xb336a86e2feb1e87a328fcb7dd4d04de3df254d0
// and was compiled (using optimization) with:
// Solidity version: 0.2.1-fad2d4df/.-Emscripten/clang/int linked to libethereum

// For future versions it would be nice to ...
// TODO - enforce time-limit on reign (can contracts do that without external action)?
// TODO - add a random reset?
// TODO - add bitcoin bridge so agents can pay in bitcoin?
// TODO - maybe allow different return payment address?

//added pragma version
pragma solidity ^0.4.0;
